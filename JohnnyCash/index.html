                <br><br>
                    After his good friend and fellow Sun alum Carl Perkins fell from grace due to a crippling car accident and alcoholism, Cash took him on as a touring guitarist and supported Perkins by performing songs written by him. In the 1970s he tried to help his close friend, legendary Nashville guitarist Hank Garland, restart his career by bringing him into the studio to record. In the 1980s, he teamed up with Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson to record an album. Its success led to two follow ups and several tours.

                    His cameo vocal appearance on The Wanderer on U2's Zooropa album led to a meeting with producer Rick Rubin and ultimately resulted in the American Recordings series of albums, which feature many collaborations. The band Coldplay had intended to record the song "Til Kingdom Come" from X&Y with Cash, but he died before they could. The song is dedicated to Cash on the album and on their "Twisted Logic Tour" where they also perform "Ring of Fire." </p></div></div>
