                <p>A new restaurant dedicated to the Man in Black has opened in downtown Nashville.
                    “We now have about 60-thousand square feet of Johnny Cash on this block," Bill
                    Miller, owner of both the Johnny Cash Museum and the new Johnny Cash's Kitchen and Saloon, said.
                    "When you walk in here, it's ike walking into Johnny and June's home."</p>
                <p>The menu for the kitchen features traditional Southern food and is made in partnership with Swett’s, a
                    restaurant that Cash visited back in the day with his family.</p>

        <h2>Sheryl Crow Collaboration</h2>

                <p> Sheryl Crow released a song Friday that’s not exactly new. "Redemption Day" was originally released in
                    1996 on her multi-platinum self-titled album. But for the Nashville-based Grammy winner, the song has
                    new meaning and new weight, thanks to the voice of an old friend: Johnny Cash.
                    Crow’s original 1996 recording came in the form of a train song, a chugalong track with an ascendant
                    chorus. Crow says she wrote the song after taking a trip to war-torn Bosnia and seeing news reports
                    about the Rwandan genocide.</p>
                <p>Johnny Cash covered "Redemption Day" shortly before he died, and it was released on a posthumous
                    compilation. Sheryl Crow first used the Cash recording live on a tour in 2014 with her band.</p>

        <h2>Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears</h2>

                    In 1964, Johnny Cash released a Native American-themed concept album, “Bitter Tears: Ballads of the
                    American Indian.” In an incredible but little-known story, Cash faced censorship and backlash for
                    speaking out on behalf of native people — and he fought back.
                    A new documentary airing this month on PBS, “Johnny Cash’s Bitter Tears,” tells the story of the
                    controversy. For the album’s 50th anniversary, it was re-recorded with contributions from musicians
                    including Kris Kristofferson and Emmylou Harris, and the documentary also chronicles the making of the
                    new album.
