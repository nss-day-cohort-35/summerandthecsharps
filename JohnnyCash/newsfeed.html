                    A new restaurant dedicated to the Man in Black has opened in downtown Nashville.<br>
                    <blockquote>“We now have about 60-thousand square feet of Johnny Cash on this block,"</blockquote> Bill Miller, owner of both the Johnny Cash Museum and the new Johnny Cash's Kitchen and Saloon, said. <blockquote>"When you walk in here, it's ike walking into Johnny and June's home."</blockquote><br>
                    The menu for the kitchen features traditional Southern food and is made in partnership with Swett’s, a restaurant that Cash visited back in the day with his family.

                <h2>Sheryl Crow Collaboration</h2>
                <img src="images/sherylcrow.jpeg" alt="Sheryl Crow Collaboration">
                <p>
                    Sheryl Crow released a song Friday that’s not exactly new. "Redemption Day" was originally released in 1996 on her multi-platinum self-titled album. But for the Nashville-based Grammy winner, the song has new meaning and new weight, thanks to the voice of an old friend: Johnny Cash.
                    Crow’s original 1996 recording came in the form of a train song, a chugalong track with an ascendant chorus. Crow says she wrote the song after taking a trip to war-torn Bosnia and seeing news reports about the Rwandan genocide.
                    Johnny Cash covered "Redemption Day" shortly before he died, and it was released on a posthumous compilation. Sheryl Crow first used the Cash recording live on a tour in 2014 with her band.

                <h2>Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears</h2>
                <img src="images/bittertears.jpeg" alt="Bitter Tears">
                <p>
                    In 1964, Johnny Cash released a Native American-themed concept album, “Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian.” In an incredible but little-known story, Cash faced censorship and backlash for speaking out on behalf of native people — and he fought back. <br>
                    A new documentary airing this month on PBS, “Johnny Cash’s Bitter Tears,” tells the story of the controversy. For the album’s 50th anniversary, it was re-recorded with contributions from musicians including Kris Kristofferson and Emmylou Harris, and the documentary also chronicles the making of the new album.
